### C2: Convert Minutes into Seconds

Write a function that takes an integer minutes and converts it into seconds. Examples convert(5) ->300.     (Edabit(VE))



### C3: Return the next number from the integer passed

Create a function that takes a number as an argument, increments the number by +1 and returns the result. Examples: addition(0) ->1, addition(9) ->10.      (Edabit(VE))
