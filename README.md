# JS Algorithm Challenges


### C1: Return the Sum of two numbers

Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and return their sum. Examples addition(3,2) ->5, addition(-3,-6) ->-9.   ( Edabit(VE)) 



### C2: Convert Minutes into Seconds

Write a function that takes an integer minutes and converts it into seconds. Examples convert(5) ->300.     (Edabit(VE))



### C3: Return the next number from the integer passed

Create a function that takes a number as an argument, increments the number by +1 and returns the result. Examples: addition(0) ->1, addition(9) ->10.      (Edabit(VE))



### C4: Area of a Triangle

Write a function that takes the base and height of a triangle and return its area. Examples triArea(3,2) ->3.       (Edabit(VE))



### C5: Less than 100

Given two numbers, return true if the sum of both numbers is less than 100. Otherwise return false. Example lessThan(22,35) ->true, lessthan(55,65) ->false.        (Edabit(VE))



### C6: Football Points

Create a function that takes the number of wins, draws and losses and calculate the number of points a football team has obtained so far, wins(3pt), draw(1pt), lose(0pt). Example footballPoints(3,4,2) ->13. Inputs will be numbers greater than or equal to zero.        (Edabit(VE))




### C7: The Farm Problem

A farmer is asking you to tell how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species: chickens(2 legs), Cows(4 legs), pigs(4 legs). The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals. Example animals(2,3,5) ->36. Order of animals passed is animals(chickens, cows, pigs).



### C8: Recursion: Length of a String

Write a function that returns the length of a string. Make your function recursive. Examples length("apple") ->5, length("a") ->1, length("") ->0.



### C9: Frames per Second

Create a function that returns the number of frames shown in a given number of minutes for a certain FPS. Examples frames(1,1) ->60, frames(10, 1) ->600, frames(10, 25) ->15000.       (Edabit(VE))



### C10: Upvotes vs Downvotes

Given an object containing counts of both upvotes and downvotes, return what vote count should be displayed. This is calculted by substracting the number of downvotes from upvotes. Examples: getVoteCount({upvotes:13, downvotes:0}) ->13, getVoteCount({upvotes:2, downvotes:33}) ->-31, getVoteCount({upvotes:132, downvotes:132}) ->0. You can expect only positive integers for vote counts.
