    Challenge39: Number Length Sort

    Create a sorting function which sorts 
    numbers not by numerical order, 
    but by number length!. 
    This means sorting numbers with the least 
    amount of digits first, up to the numbers 
    with the most digits. 
Example: 
numberLenSort([1,54,1,2,463,2]) -> [1,1,2,2,54,463], 
([9,8,7,6,5,4,31,4,31,2,1,3]) -> [9,8,7,6,5,4,2,1,3,31].
Notes: if two numbers have the same number of digits, 
return them in the order they first appeared
(this makes it different to just sorting the numbers normally).
